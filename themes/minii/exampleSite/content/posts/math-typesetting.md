Mathematical notation can be enabled in Hugo using various JavaScript libraries, such as KaTeX or MathJax. Once set up, you can write LaTeX-style math equations directly in your Markdown content.

## Example Equations

When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ and they are
$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$

Inline math: $e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$

Block math:
$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi}
$$
