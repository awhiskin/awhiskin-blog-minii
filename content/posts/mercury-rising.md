I recently came across a [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/TShJhUdljX8?t=811&si=YxRgP22dTxUuoZdW) discussing various mods for *Halo: Combat Evolved*. The last mod on the list is a mod called *Mercury Rising* by altis94. Here's a [link to the mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3021510694) on the Steam Workshop. 

I downloaded and played through *Mercury Rising* today, and wanted to write a post gushing about how much I liked it. The mod features two missions, and while I did enjoy the first mission, I'd really like to discuss the second mission as this was by far my favourite.

To start with, it has one of the cleanest transitions into gameplay I've ever seen in a cutscene, let alone in a game engine from 20+ years ago. This was something I didn't even know was possible in the original *Halo* engine! It's literally as seamless as something from the Forza Horizon games! 

Damn, *Mercury Rising*, you didn't have to go all out so soon!

Not long after, you emerge from a Forerunner-built tunnel, and get to soak in the gorgeous vista in front of you. In the distance, a Forerunner tower shoots a column of energy straight up into the sky. A small tent off to the left shelters a couple of weary Marines. Over the nearest hill is a Covenant squad guarding another Forerunner structure, ready to attack if you stray too close.

Suddenly, a pack of short bipedal aliens crests the hill and gallops past. Heading the pack is a Covenant Grunt, proudly riding one of the creatures. After a second, I couldn't help but burst out laughing; I immediately knew I was going to like this mod.

This mod definitely has a sense of humour. It's not afraid to crack jokes and be its own, quirky self. Although not all of the jokes land, I love that the mod wears its personality loudly and proudly. There's a few parts I found a bit grating; the UNSC Marine turret that you collect at the start of the mission is a great concept, but I did find its voice lines got pretty repetitive and its jokes felt pretty out of place. At one point, it told me "Nice driving, my dude!" which felt pretty cringey.

## Soundtrack 

While we're talking about the mod's personality, I need to mention the amazing soundtrack!

While it's definitely different to the familiar Marty O'Donnell and Michael Salvatore soundtrack Halo fans all know and love, the ethereal soundtrack by [cheechas](https://cheechas.bandcamp.com/album/overture-ep) is something special. For me, it felt perfect; it nails the atmosphere and vibe of an early 2000's game like *Halo: Combat Evolved*, and puts its own unique spin on it. Tracks are varied without outstaying their welcome, fitting seamleslly into the experience as you naturally move back and forth between quiet exploration and heated combat with the many, many Covenant patrols across the lush, expansive environment. You can listen to one of the tracks from the mod [here on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6GpukwEnsY).

## Environment

{{< figure src="/images/forerunner.jpg" >}}

Speaking of the environment, my god, do I love the environmental design in this mod! Something about the island environment, with its gorgeous rolling hills, caves, cliffs and beaches, really struck a chord with me. The environments in *Halo: Combat Evolved* have always felt a bit... liminal. There's actually a few YouTube videos covering this topic that go into deeper detail on this topic:

- [Old Halo Games Were Creepy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7QXWj98ERI)
- [Unremarkable and odd places in Halo: Combat Evolved](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMSenHGooJk)

I think the environment in *Mercury Rising II* absolutely feels like a bit of a liminal space - and I love that! I think that's the point of these vast, gorgeous, artificial Forerunner landscapes; they are supposed to feel artificial and a little bit wrong. They are decidedly unnatural places. Bungie absolutely nailed this design in the original Halo trilogy, and altis94 has pulled off such a great job making an environment that feels authentic and right at place in a Halo game, but also is quite fun to play in!

There's also plenty of "secret" areas and easter eggs. My favourite was this small island where you can find a wounded Marine who has ended up marooned here.

## What didn't I like?

My only real gripes with the mod were to do with the difficulty and checkpoint pacing. I played on Normal mode and felt like the enemies were definitely a bit bullet spongey. Generally, it didn't feel too unfair, and I think on subsequent playthroughs, with more familiarity of enemy types and combat tactics, fights would feel less one-sided. 

However, dear God the checkpoints felt unfair at times, often having to trek back across 1/3 of the map to return to the fight after dying. I often resorted to circling enemy encounters for 30 seconds to try and trigger a checkpoint manually before running in.

## Overall

I'd highly recommend giving this mod a crack. It's clearly a labour of love by many talented individuals. It took me about 5 minutes to install and a couple of hours to play through and beat. I plan on playing through the mod at least once more to try and find any more secrets and just explore the island once again, soaking up the stunning views and the gorgeous soundtrack.

There's so much more I haven't even mentioned, like the new weapons, vehicles, enemy types, etc.
It would take me too long to talk about everything and I probably wouldn't do it justice.

If you've already got Halo: Combat Evolved as part of the [Master Chief Collection on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/976730/), do yourself a favour and give it a go! It's a very fun, fresh take on the tried and true Halo formula.
